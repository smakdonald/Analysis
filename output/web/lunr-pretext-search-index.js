  "body": "How to Use This Book  I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this is for. Some possibilities include:   Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I will teach a course over this material.    Current notes for students taking the first year analysis sequence.    Assistance in studying for the Analysis Qualifying Exam at UNL.    Clout.     Blocks  Here are the types of environments you are likely to encounter throughout the text and what they are used for.  Definition  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. The building blocks of what we'll be working with.   Examples  Specific instances of a definition. For example, the empty set, is an example of a set, and thus would be contained within an example environment. At some point the line between example and definition becomes incoherently blurred, but I have done my best to keep things consistent.   Theorem  A result.   Lemma  A more technical result used specifically in the proof of a larger result.   Corollary  An important result whose proof comes directly from a previous theorem.   Proposition  Results that require proof but are more specific and\/or contained in a larger result coming later.   Exploration  Generalizations, specifics, smaller results, things are are less essential to the course or results who's proofs are usually skipped.   Problem  Used for qualifying exam problems.   Remark  Providing context in the form of foreshadowing or content not covered in this text. In general, there shouldn't be anything defined in a remark, they should be entirely optional.   Discussion  Usually for arguing about notation.   Context  Historical and etymogical origins.   Footnotes  Sometimes act like remarks. However, most are strictly for fun and add little to no educational value, at least in the traditional sense. It should really be feetnote if you think about it.       "

The usual notation for a real sequence is {an} , where a denotes the function from into and is the value of the function at the positive integer . The notations a1, a2, . . . and {an} are also used to denote a real sequence. The number an is called the nth term of the sequence.     A sequence may be defined by giving an explicit formula for the term. For example, the formula defines the sequence whose value at the positive integer is .

Convergent, Divergent Sequences   We say  converges if there exists some such that and we say  diverges otherwise.    Uniqueness of Sequence Limits   The limit of a sequence is unique.

Let be real int with (exists by Archimedian property of real numbers). Now if follow equalities and inequalities to     Bounded Sequences    I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true.   Abraham Lincoln   Bounded Sequence   A sequence is bounded if exists such that .    Convergent Sequences are Bounded   If a sequence {an}∞n=1 converges then it is bounded.    Suppose the sequence {an}∞n=1 converges to the number L. Applying the definition of “converges to L” using the particular value ε = 1 gives the following fact: There is a real number N such that if n ∈ N and n > N , then |an −L| < 1. The latter inequality is equivalent to L − 1 < an < L + 1 for all n > N.  Let m be any natural number such that m > N , and consider the finite list of numbers a1, a2, . . . , am−1, L + 1. Let b be the largest element of this list. I claim the sequence is bounded above by b. For any n ∈ N, if 1 ≤ n ≤ m − 1, then an ≤ b since in this case an is a member of the above list and b is the largest element of this list. If n ≥ m then since m > N , we have n > N and hence an < L + 1 from above. We also have L + 1 ≤ b (since L + 1 is in the list) and thus an < b. This proves an ≤ b for all n as claimed.  Now take p to be the smallest number in the list a1, a2, . . . , am−1, L − 1. A similar argument shows that an ≥ p for all n ∈ N.      If then     By the triangle inequality, so . Also so .      If , then             If exists such that for all , and sequence converges to                            The Squeeze Theorem   Suppose \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1}, {bn}∞ n=1, and {cn}∞ n=1 are three sequences such that \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} and {cn}∞ n=1 both converge to L, and an ≤ bn ≤ cn for all n. Then {bn}∞ n=1 also converges to L.    Assume \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} and {cn}∞ n=1 both converge to L and that an ≤bn ≤ cn for all n ∈ N. We need to prove {bn}∞ n=1 converges to L. Pick ε > 0. Since \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} converges to L there is a number N1 such that if n ∈ N and n > N1 then |an−L| < ε and hence L−ε < an < L+ε. Likewise, since {cn}∞ n=1 converges to L there is a number N2 such that if n ∈ N and n > N2 then L − ε < cn < L + ε. Let N = max{N1, N2}. If n ∈ N and n > N , then n > N1 and hence L − ε < an, and n > N2 and hence cn < L + ε, and also an ≤ bn ≤ cn. Combining these facts gives that for n ∈ N such that n > N , we have L − ε < bn < L + ε and hence |bn − L| < ε. This proves {bn}∞ n=1 converges to L.      Let {an} and {bn} be sequences such that {an} is bounded and limn→∞ bn = 0. Then limn→∞ anbn = 0.    There exists a positive number M such that an ≤ M for every positive integer n. Let > 0. There exists a positive integer N such that if n N, then |b_n|<\\e\/M If n N, then |a_nb_n|<M\\e\/M=\\e.     Monotonicity    I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone.   Nicki Minaj   Monotone Sequence   Suppose \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is any sequence.   We say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is increasing if for all n ∈ N, an ≤ an+1. If this inequality is strict, we say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is strictly increasing.    We say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is decreasing if for all n ∈ N, an ≥ an+1. If this inequality is strict, we say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is strictly decreasing.    We say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is monotone if it is either decreasing or increasing. If this inequality is strict, we say \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is strictly monotone.        Be sure to interpret “monotone” correctly. It means (∀n ∈ N, an ≤ an+1) or (∀n ∈ N, an ≥ an+1); it does not mean ∀n ∈ N, (an ≤ an+1) or (an ≥ an+1). Do you see the difference?   Increasing and Bounded Sequence Converges   Every increasing, bounded above sequence converges.    Let S be the set of those real numbers that occur in this sequence. (This is technically different that the sequence itself, since sequences are allowed to have repetitions but sets are not. Also, sequences have an ordering to them, but sets do not.) The set S is clearly nonempty, and it is bounded above since we assume the sequence is bounded above. Therefore, by the Completeness Axiom, S has a supremum L. We will prove the sequence converges to L.  Pick ε > 0. Then L − ε < L and, since L is the supremum, L − ε is not an upper bound of S. This means that there is an element of S that is strictly bigger than L−ε. Every element of S is a member of the sequence, and so we get that there is an N ∈ N such that aN > L − ε.  (We will next show that this is the N that “works”. Note that, in the general definition of convergence of a sequence, N can be any real number, but in this proof it turns out to be a natural number.)  Let n be any natural number such that n > N. Since the sequence is increasing, aN ≤ an and hence L − ε < aN ≤ an. Also, an ≤ L since L is an upper bound for the sequence, and thus we have L − ε < an ≤ L. It follows that |an − L| < ε. We have proven the sequence converges to L.    Monotone Convergence   Every bounded monotone sequence converges.    If \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is increasing, then this is the content of Theorem 11.3. If \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is decreasing and bounded, consider the sequence {−an}∞ n=1. If an ≤ M for all n, then −an ≥ −M for all n, so {−an}∞ n=1 is bounded below. Also, since an ≥ an+1 for all n, we have −an ≤ −an+1 for all n, so {−an}∞ n=1 is increasing. Thus, by Theorem 11.3, {−an}∞ n=1 converges, say to L. Then by Theorem 10.2(1), \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} = {−(−an)}∞ n=1 converges to −L.      Define by for (so . We'll find .     is increasing (strictly, but this not important. First note . Further if and , then   If and then and so bounded above by induction. Now we have that converges to something. Let . Since , we have . Now and so and .    Convergence to Real Numbers   For any real number r, there exists a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers that converges to r.    We will construct a sequence of rational numbers {qn}∞ n=1 such that r− 1 n < qn < r for every n that is strictly increasing, and then show that this sequence converges to r. By Density of Rational Numbers, there exists a rational number q1 such that r − 1 < q < r. Given q1, . . . , qn, we define qn+1 recursively to be a rational number such that max{r − 1 n+1 , qn} < qn+1 < r again using Density of Rational Numbers. To see that this rule makes sense, we observe that if we have constructed q1, . . . , qn by this rule, then qn < r, so max{r − 1 n+1 , qn} < r, and hence Density of Rational number applies, so we can construct qn+1 (and hence we can construct qn for any n by this rule). Since qn ≤ max{r − 1 n + 1, qn} < qn+1 for every n, the sequence we obtain is strictly increasing. Since r − 1 n < qn < r for every n and {r − 1 n }∞ n=1 converges to r, by the Squeeze Theorem, the sequence {qn}∞ n=1 converges to r.     "

Note that k is the index of the subsequence; i.e., the first term in the subsequence is when k = 1, the second is when k = 2 and so on. The integer sequence {nk}∞ k=1 is the sequence of indices of the original sequence we choose to make the subsequence.     Let b1, b2, . . . be any strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers; that is, assume bk ∈ N for all k ∈ N and that bk < bk+1 for all k ∈ N. Then bk ≥ k for all k.    Suppose b1, b2, . . . is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. We prove bn ≥ n for all n by induction on n. That is, for each n ∈ N, let Pn be the statement that bn ≥ n.  P1 is true since b1 ∈ N and so b1 ≥ 1. Given k ∈ N, assume Pk is true; that is, assume bk ≥ k. Since bk+1 > bk and both are natural numbers, we have bk+1 ≥ bk + 1 ≥ k + 1; that is, Pk+1 is true too. By induction, Pn is true for all n ∈ N.    Subsequence Limits   If a sequence \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} converges to L, then every subsequence of this sequence also converges to L.    Let the sequence \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} converge to L, and take a subsequence {ank }∞ k=1 for some strictly increasing sequence n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · of natural numbers.  Let ε > 0. Since \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} converges to L, there is some N ∈ R such that for all natural numbers n > N we have |an − L| < ε. We claim that the same N works to verify the definition of {ank }∞ k=1 converges to L for this ε. Indeed, if k > N , then nk > N , so |ank − L| < ε. Thus, {ank }∞ k=1 converges to L.      Let \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} be a sequence.   If the set of values of the sequence {an | n ∈ N} does not have a maximum value, then \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} has a subsequence that is increasing.    If the set of values of the sequence {an | n ∈ N} does not have a minimum value, then \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} has a subsequence that is decreasing.          Assume that the set of values {an | n ∈ N} does not have a maximum value.  We define a subsequence recursively. We will recursively choose natural numbers n1, n2, n3, . . . so that nk < nk+1 for all k and ank ≤ ank+1 .  We start by setting n1 = 1.  If we have chosen nk, then let b = max{a1, . . . , ank }.  We claim that there is some m > nk such that am > b. To obtain a contradiction, suppose otherwise. Then for any n ∈ N, either n > nk and an ≤ b by assumption, or n ≤ nk and an ≤ b, since an is on the list of things of which b was the maximum. Then b is the maximum of {an | n ∈ N}, which yields a contradiction. Thus, there is some m > nk such that am > b, and we can choose m = nk+1. Thus, we can define such a sequence recursively.    Similar to (1), or apply (1) to {−an}∞n=1.       Balzano-Weierstrass   Every sequence has a monotone subsequence.    Let \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} be any sequence. Recall that our goal is to prove it either has an increasing subsequence or it has a decreasing subsequence. This is equivalent to showing that if it has no increasing subsequences, then it does have at least one decreasing subsequence. So, let us assume it has no increasing subsequences.  We will prove it has at least one decreasing subsequence by constructing the indices n1 < n2 < · · · of such a subsequence recursively. By the contrapositive of part (1) Lemma 16.4 , since \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} does not contain any increasing subsequences, we know that {an | n ∈ N} has a maximum value.

For any k, given nk, the subsequence ank +1, ank +2, ank +3, . . . also has no increasing subsequence, since a subsequence of such a sequence is a subsequence of the original sequence too.

Thus, this gives a recursive definition for nk.  For any k, note that ank is the maximum of a set that contains ank+1 (since it is later in the sequence). It follows that ank ≥ ank+1. That is, we have constructed a decreasing subsequence of the original sequence.      Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.    Suppose \\{a_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1} is a bounded sequence.

We will prove it has at least one decreasing subsequence by constructing the indices n1 < n2 < · · · of such a subsequence recursively.
