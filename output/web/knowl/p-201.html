<div class="para">We claim that there is some m &gt; nk such that am &gt; b. To obtain a contradiction, suppose otherwise. Then for any n ∈ N, either n &gt; nk and an ≤ b by assumption, or n ≤ nk and an ≤ b, since an is on the list of things of which b was the maximum. Then b is the maximum of {an | n ∈ N}, which yields a contradiction. Thus, there is some m &gt; nk such that am &gt; b, and we can choose m = nk+1. Thus, we can define such a sequence recursively.</div>
