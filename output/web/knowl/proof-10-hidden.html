<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">Let S be the set of those real numbers that occur in this sequence. (This is technically different that the sequence itself, since sequences are allowed to have repetitions but sets are not. Also, sequences have an ordering to them, but sets do not.) The set S is clearly nonempty, and it is bounded above since we assume the sequence is bounded above. Therefore, by the Completeness Axiom, S has a supremum L. We will prove the sequence converges to L.</div> <div class="para">Pick ε &gt; 0. Then L − ε &lt; L and, since L is the supremum, L − ε is not an upper bound of S. This means that there is an element of S that is strictly bigger than L−ε. Every element of S is a member of the sequence, and so we get that there is an N ∈ N such that aN &gt; L − ε.</div> <div class="para">(We will next show that this is the N that “works”. Note that, in the general definition of convergence of a sequence, N can be any real number, but in this proof it turns out to be a natural number.)</div> <div class="para">Let n be any natural number such that n &gt; N. Since the sequence is increasing, aN ≤ an and hence L − ε &lt; aN ≤ an. Also, an ≤ L since L is an upper bound for the sequence, and thus we have L − ε &lt; an ≤ L. It follows that |an − L| &lt; ε. We have proven the sequence converges to L.</div></article></body>
