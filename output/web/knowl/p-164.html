<div class="para">Let S be the set of those real numbers that occur in this sequence. (This is technically different that the sequence itself, since sequences are allowed to have repetitions but sets are not. Also, sequences have an ordering to them, but sets do not.) The set S is clearly nonempty, and it is bounded above since we assume the sequence is bounded above. Therefore, by the Completeness Axiom, S has a supremum L. We will prove the sequence converges to L.</div>
